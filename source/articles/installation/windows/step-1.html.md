MSYS2 provide a unix terminal environment for Windows. We will need this to run the build commands to create our SplashKit programs.

1. Download the correct version of [MSYS](http://www.msys2.org) (32bit or 64bit depending on your computer).

1. Run the installer and follow the installation wizard, with default values. (Do not install in a location with spaces in the path!)
